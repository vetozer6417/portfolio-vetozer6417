# My Portfolio Website!!😀

  

This portfolio website is inspired by Windows 98 User Interface and also from [PitViper](https://www.pitviper.com/) website.

I created this website for personal study of Next.JS and to use it as my portfolio.

I developed this website using Next.Js with TailwindCSS for quickness and easiness.

Thanks for some of the icons downloaded from [Windows 98 Icon Viewer](https://win98icons.alexmeub.com/) and [pixel-icon-library](https://github.com/hackernoon/pixel-icon-library.git).
